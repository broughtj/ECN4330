## Syllabus

### Course Description

This course is an introduction to econometrics for finance. This differs from a typical introductory econometrics course in that the motivating examples
will all come from the domain of finance. The course will cover much more on time series econometrics than a typical econometrics course, and therefore
less on other traditional subjects. Sub-themes will be on computational methods, and connections to other areas of statistical practice such as data
science and machine learning.

The course is very applied in nature. That means that I will focus more on models, methods and implementation than on formal proofs. We will cover theory
as needed, but the focus will always be on application. We will use R programming in homework assignments and class projects to implement econometric
models and methods. We will rely on the Monte Carlo simulation method as a way to build intuition and understanding of asymptotic theory.


### Prerequisites

* One of STATS 2000, 2300, or 3000
* MATH 1100 or 1210 Calculus
* Or approval of the professor

Students must be prepared to program in the R programming language for computational assignments. No prior programming experience is required! But you must
understand that this course will be demanding in a way that is likely to be new to you if you have never programmed before. 


### Course Objectives



### Textbooks

There is only one required textbook for this course:

* [Introduction to Econometrics](https://goo.gl/xqNUqp) by Gary Koop.

This is an excellent introductory textbook, and is also very affordable. A used copy of the book will suffice and is likely to be available on Amazon.com for around $30. In my opinion this is the best introductory texbook on econometrics, with just the right balance between theory and application for the absolute beginner. It is also the only introductory textbook that introduces the Bayesian paradigm, which we will explore briefly. 

The following textbooks are suggested, though not _strictly_ required:

* [Using R for Introductory Econometrics](https://goo.gl/PhA4Bh) by Florian Heiss
* [A Guide to Econometrics](https://goo.gl/gHFeaf) by Peter Kennedy

Some Notes: 

The first book is a guide to using the R programming language for econometrics and will be our source for learning R programming. The book is available to read online, but a cautious student would not rely on that (though a budget-constrained student may risk it). The website is here: [Using R for Introductory Econometrics](http://www.urfie.net/).

The second book is known as the Graduate Student's Bible for interpreting the dense language of econometrics. It is certainly meant as a ___guide___ to accompany another textbook. It's strength is found in how well it explains the thinking behind econometric theory and models. It largely succeeds at this goal. The explaination of the _sampling distribution_ is worth the price alone. It also has a good explaination of how the Monte Carlo method helps us to understand this crucial concept. 

In addition, there will be some papers that I will post that you will be required to read and report on. These will be announced in class. 

### Assessment and Grading




### Software

Economics 4330 is taught using the R programming language, a set of core scientific computing packages written and maintained by various third parties. I may also present other software from time to time for demonstration purposes. These might include Matlab, Python, C++, and Fortran. Students will not be required to learn these. 

___NB:___ Though if a diligent student desired to, I would facilitate programming in Python (which I highly recommend!).

#### R and R Markdown

We will use R for computational assignments in this class. R is a very powerful programming language, and the de facto
language for statistical computing. More and more econometricians are starting to use R as well. Its great strength is
the vast number of libraries freely available that implement statistical and econometric models and techniques. 

You can download R for your platform at <https://www.r-project.org>.

Once you have R installed you will also want to install the freely available RStudio Integrated Development Environment,
or IDE. It provides a great way to work with R, and is available for all major platforms. Be sure to download the
desktop client. It is available here: <https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download3/>. 

We will also be making use of [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) for homeworks, and projects. 

#### Slack 

All class communication will take place using [Slack](https://slack.com), a messaging system that replaces email. Students will be invited to the [Econ 4330 Slack channel](https://ecn4330.slack.com) prior to the first week of class.

Clients for most computing and mobile platforms can be [downloaded from the Slack website](https://slack.com/downloads), or students may use the web client via a desktop browser.

### Extra Credit

I will allow for the following extra credit assignments. These are not mutually exclusive.

#### Manipulation on Trial

I will allow for extra credit for a detailed report about the role of econometric methods in the Hunt silver price manipulation case as outlined in Jeffrey Williams' excellent book [Manipulation on Trial](https://goo.gl/1Wsrs3). This is not a light undertaking, and I would caution that it might be better to just spend time polishing your final project. Nevertheless, for the serious student of econometrics it will be an excellent way to learn about the use of econometrics in policy making. 

A write-up on the extra credit project will be provided if there is enough demand. 

#### Keeping a Detailed Bullet Journal

I will give extra credit for students who keep a [bullet journal](http://bulletjournal.com/) throughout the semester. You can watch a video on this on [youtube](https://youtu.be/fm15cmYU0IM). You can search social media with the hashtag #\BulletJournal for ideas and suggestions. 

The idea is to record your study and work for ECN 4330, but I would encourage you to use it broadly. I will require that you turn in a brief writeup about the experience and also at least two posts on social media with hashtags #\ECN4330 and #\BulletJournal. 

While you will see very expensive notebooks used online, it could be done for just a few dollars with [this Staples Composition Notebook](https://goo.gl/GbrXUf). But feel free to use whatever you want and to personalize it to your heart's content.
