## Syllabus

### Course Description

This course is an introduction to econometrics for finance. This differs from a typical introductory econometrics course in that the motivating examples
will all come from the domain of finance. The course will cover much more on time series econometrics than a typical econometrics course, and therefore
less on other traditional subjects. Sub-themes will be on computational methods, and connections to other areas of statistical practice such as data
science and machine learning.

The course is very applied in nature. That means that I will focus more on models, methods and implementation than on formal proofs. We will cover theory
as needed, but the focus will always be on application. We will use R programming in homework assignments and class projects to implement econometric
models and methods. We will rely on the Monte Carlo simulation method as a way to build intuition and understanding of asymptotic theory.


### Prerequisites

* One of STATS 2000, 2300, or 3000
* MATH 1100 or 1210 Calculus
* Or approval of the professor

Students must be prepared to program in the R programming language for computational assignments. No prior programming experience is required! But you must
understand that this course will be demanding in a way that is likely to be new to you if you have never programmed before. 


### Course Objectives



### Textbooks

There is only one required textbook for this course:

* [Introduction to Econometrics](https://goo.gl/xqNUqp) by Gary Koop.

This is an excellent introductory textbook, and is also very affordable. A used copy of the book will suffice and is likely to be available on Amazon.com for around $30. In my opinion this is the best introductory texbook on econometrics, with just the right balance between theory and application for the absolute beginner. It is also the only introductory textbook that introduces the Bayesian paradigm, which we will explore briefly. 

The following textbooks are suggested, though not _strictly_ required:

* [Using R for Introductory Econometrics](https://goo.gl/PhA4Bh) by Florian Heiss
* [A Guide to Econometrics](https://goo.gl/gHFeaf) by Peter Kennedy

Some Notes: 

<br> 

The first book is a guide to using the R programming language for econometrics and will be our source for learning R programming. The book is available to read online, but a cautious student would not rely on that (though a budget-constrained student may risk it). The website is here: [Using R for Introductory Econometrics](http://www.urfie.net/).

The second book is known as the Graduate Student's Bible for interpreting the dense language of econometrics. It is certainly meant as a ___guide___ to accompany another textbook. It's strength is found in how well it explains the thinking behind econometric theory and models. It largely succeeds at this goal. The explaination of the _sampling distribution_ is worth the price alone. It also has a good explaination of how the Monte Carlo method helps us to understand this crucial concept.
